First, remove duplicate headlines from [HEADLINES]. Remaining number of headlines must be greater than 15.

Second, remove headlines longer than 29 characters from [HEADLINES]. Remaining number of headlines must be greater than 15, if not generate more.

Third, remove headlines that are irrelevant to [SCRIPTURE] from [HEADLINES]. Remaining number of headlines must be greater than 15, if not generate more.

Fourth, remove the headlines that fail to comply with [GOOGLE_POLICIES] from [HEADLINES]. Remaining number of headlines must be greater than 15, if not generate more.

If more than 15 headlines remain, evaluate and choose the top 15 according to [EFFECTIVE_WRITING].

Output only the phrases, no numbering, no annotations, do not use ( ).
